Designed a conceptual model for a relational database using ER diagrams, ER diagram constraints, requirements and 
description of enterprise, and a relational schema.
Cleaned, wrangled, queried, and visualized data from IUCN Redlist of Threatened Species public data.

# About
This project was completed to design and implement a database using public data from the IUCN Redlist of 
Threatened Species. The database schema and table structures I designed were used to implement a MySQL
database. I first wrote SQL DDL instructions for defining the relations in the database. Python (pandas) was
then used to wrangle the data into csv files generated to populate the relational databases defined in MySQL. 
Two queries were then defined and executed from the database. Matplotlib was used to visualize the data 
from the queries.
